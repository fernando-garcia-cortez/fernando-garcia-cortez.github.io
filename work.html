				<h1>Fernando Garcia Cortez</h1>
				<h3>Independent study</h3>
				<p>At the moment, I am enjoying some more advanced texts on Cosmology and Quantum Field Theory, as well as numerical methods.</p>
				<h3>Ongoing work: Cosmological CMB differentiable code</h3>
				<p>I am in the initial stages of developing a fully differentiable CMB cosmology code.
				Differentiability opens the door to many possibilities, such as faster parameter estimation,
				but most importantly, it allows us to constrain models with an immense number of parameters.</p>
                <h3>Ongoing work: BCS inspired dark matter</h3>
				<p>I am currently following the work of my senior honors thesis at the University
				 of New Mexico about a model of dark matter based on the BCS theory of superconductivity.
				 I am about to start working on MCMC analysis of the model, which will provide me with a statistical
				 description of how well this model fits with observed cosmological data, as well as an estimation of
				 the parameters of the model.</p>

				<h3>Previous work</h3>
				<p>In the past, I have worked on thermal field theory, neutrino physics
				in a cosmological context, applications of representation theory to 
				quantum field theory, as well as some geophysics and photonics.</p>
