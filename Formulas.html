			<p>The purpose of this collection is twofold:</p>
			
			<p><b>Personal:</b> I am at a point in my career in which taking notes "for the sake of having a keepsake of the time I invested" takes way too much of my already limited time. This approach not only scratches the aforementioned itch, but it is, in many ways, more useful than a 500-page TeX-typed pdf.</p>
			
			<p><b>Contributory:</b> As I study many subjects, either as a student or a researcher, I noticed that there aren't that many  sources like the present one. Most people tend to have their go-to book for formulas and quick refreshers. I am not a one-textbook-person, so here's an attempt at something different.</p>
			
			<p>Find below links to various collections, created with care and purpose, on some of my favorite topics. Relevant sources will be mentioned at the beginning of each collection. These should not be used for rote learning (memorizing formulas won't make you a field theorist!), but rather for practical application.</p>
			
			<p>Unless otherwise noted, the collections should not be considered  "complete" or "finalized."</p>
