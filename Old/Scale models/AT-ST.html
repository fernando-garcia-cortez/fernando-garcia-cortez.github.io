        <p>I started this model on Sunday, December 4th 2022. The model was finished on the 5th of June, 2023. This model of the Imperial All Terrain Scout Transport Walker comes with 2 pilots and Chewbacca.</p>
        <p>Although the kit comes pre-painted (for the most part), I will be adding additional details using:</p>
        
        <img src="AT-ST/materials.png" class="centerImg" style="width: 35%">
        <ul>
            <li>Vallejo White Surface primer.</li>
            <li>AK 11210 (metallic) Natural Steel paint.</li>
            <li>Tamiya Black Panel Line accent color.</li>
            <li>Tamiya XF-58 Olive green paint.</li>
            <li>Tamiya XF-51 Khaki Drab paint.</li>
            <li>Tamiya XF-14 J. A. Grey paint.</li>
            <li>Tamiya XF-24 Drak Grey paint.</li>
            <li>Vallejo Thick Mud.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Torso</h3>
        <p>This is the first thing to built following the manual:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/1-Torso.PNG" class="centerImg" style="width: 30%;">
        <p>The only things that were painted for this section were the little hoses/tubes with AK 11210 (metallic) Natural Steel paint.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/paintedtubes.png" class="centerImg" style="width: 35%">
        <p>A lot of panel lines were painted with Tamiya's Black Panel Line accent color. The end result looks like:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/PaintedTorso.png" class="centerImg" style="width: 85%;">
        <h3>Legs and Neck (December 6, 2022)</h3>
        <p>Here's a picture of the legs and neck before painting and adding details:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/legs.jpg" class="centerImg" style="width: 50%;">
        <h3>Minifigures and Cockpit (June 5, 2023)</h3>
        <p>After a long pause due to school, I was able to come back and finish the most detailed parts of this model: the minifigures and the cockpit.</p>
        <p>As my model experience so far consisted of big mechas or machines, these 2 parts were certainly a challenge. I realized not too long after starting that my brushes were not small enough. Still the results came out better than I was expecting!</p>
        <p>A preliminary coat of primer was applied to both pilots:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1227.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>At this point I decided on also work on Chewbacca. This way all the minifigures would be ready at the same time.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1229.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>The light green/grey on the pilots' suits is <span style="background-color:#e8e6bd">Tamiya's XF-14 J.A. Grey</span>. The boots were painted with <span style="background-color:#4d5a6b;color:white;">Tamiya's XF-24 Dark Grey</span> The googles/shades were painted with primer only (Vallejo Mecha Primer Black). Chewbacca's bandolier was painted with the same Vallejo Black primer, and then <span style="background-color:#a9a8a3">AK11210 Natural Steel</span> was used for the accents. I decided to paint the bag in the bandolier using the same <span style="background-color:#e8e6bd">Tamiya's XF-14 J.A. Grey</span> used for the pilots' suits.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1240.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        
        
        
        
        <p>A combination of <span style="background-color:#c6231a">AK11089 Blood red</span>, <span style="background-color:#fdc500">AK11045 Deep yellow</span>, and White Vallejo surface primer was used to get a skin tone color for the pilots.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1235.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>While waiting for the minifigures to dry, I added some details to the inside of the cockpit:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/inside-cockpit.PNG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>Due to the lack of small brushes, I decided on only giving some wear and use looks to the inside. Ideally, some color would have been fantastic.</p>
        <p>With dry minifigures, I painted their belts/vests using <span style="background-color:#29320d;color:white;">Tamiya's XF-51 Khaki Drab</span>.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1268.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>The rest of the cockpit was built keeping the original tones for the most part.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1271.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <br>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1273.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>I decided on going for an open look. The front windows and the top hatch are open, and through the hatch Chewbacca can look out from inside the cabin.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1277.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>Final details were added to the cockpit. In particular, hoses were painted in <span style="background-color:#a9a8a3">AK11210 Natural Steel</span>.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1296.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>The inside of the cockpit can be seen if we look closely:</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1290.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <h3>Complete model</h3>
        <p>At this point, the model was able to stand by itself for the first time.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1299.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>After finishing adding all of the weapons, I took some pictures over a background in Endor.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1300.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 70%;">
        <br>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1309.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 70%;">
        <br>

        <br>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1321.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 70%;">
        <h3>Baseplate and weathering</h3>
        <p>The base included with the model is a brown piece of plastic. I originally planned on trying out Vallejo's Thick Mud Acrylic Paste.</p>
        <p>After reading a bit on how to use it, I learned that it also acts as a glue. For this reason, I decided on acquiring a few diorama plants and other environmental details to improve the looks of this baseplate.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1434.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>I started with superficial dirt weathering on the legs using Tamiya's Weathering Master (model C). This was my first time using this. It was a bit strange at first, but after a few attempts I got a better grip on how it should be applied.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1426.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>Minimal dirt spots were put to leave room to add oil/scratch/chipping marks.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1429.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <br>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1431.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <br>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1432.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>Using a ripped piece of sponge, I was able to paint black stains on certain parts of the body to give some oil/scratch/chipping marks.</p>
        <p>With pretty much 98% of the weathering was completed on the body, I started working on the baseplate. A first layer of Vallejo Thick Mud was applied using a plastic knife.</p>
        
        <p>The consistency of this material is like soft butter, but sticky as peanut butter. After covering a few zones, my technique started to improve.</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1435.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>One big mistake is to use the whole blade of the knife. This paste is easier to manipulate if we only work with the tip, that is, like a spatula.</p>
        <p>One I finished laying down a decently thick layer of the mud, I placed a bunch of plants and rocks. The mud by itself looks quite good, but the small rocks bring it to life without a doubt!</p>
        <img src="AT-ST/IMG_1436.JPG" class="centerImg" style="width: 60%;">
        <p>It was quite unclear how the Tamiya's Weathering Master's brown tones were going to blend with the thick mud paste, but after putting some mud over the legs I realized it was a good decision to use a bit of both.</p>
