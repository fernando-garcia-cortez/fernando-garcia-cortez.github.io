				<h1>Fernando Garcia Cortez</h1>
				<h3>Independent study</h3>
				<p>At the moment, I am enjoying some texts on dark energy, inflation, computational methods, and strings.</p>
                <h3>Ongoing work: BCS inspired dark matter</h3>
				<p>I am currently following the work of my senior honors thesis at the University
				 of New Mexico about a model of dark matter based on the BCS theory of superconductivity.
				 I am about to start working on MCMC analysis of the model, which will provide me with a statistical
				 description of how well this model fits with observed cosmological data, as well as an estimation of
				 the parameters of the model.</p>

				<h3>Previous work</h3>
				<p>In the past, I have worked on thermal field theory, neutrino physics
				in a cosmological context, applications of representation theory to 
				quantum field theory, as well as some geophysics and photonics.</p>
