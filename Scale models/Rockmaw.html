			<p>After building a few scale models over the past few years, I took some interest in a more paint-centered variation of the hobby: Miniature painting.</p>
			
			<p>I have had some interest in painting models from games like Warhammer, Battletech, and Star Wars Legion. Still, I wanted to test my skills with a more budget friendly miniature.</p>
        
			<p>After looking at a bunch of miniatures at my local hobby store, the Rockmaw from Bones caught my attention. Looking back at it, I think it was the simplicity of the figure along with its subtle details. In addition, I had in mind some techniques to apply to this model that I learned with a few online tutorials I watched before heading to the hobby store.</p>
			
			<p>Even though the mini was under \$5.00 US Dollars, I paid more than \$50.00 if I also count the miniature size brushes (The Army Painter's Wargamer Small Drybrush, Regiment Brush, and Insane Detail Brush) and new paints (list below).</p>
			
			<p>After spending a solid half an hour picking a mini, I realized that I picked a mini without a reference picture. For the first time I had complete liberty and control as to what colors to use and how to use them (Contrary to Gundams, for instance, where you usually follow the painted pictures).</p>
			
			<p>After a few minutes walking in circles, I had the idea of painting this Rockmaw like the Cacodemons from Doom (2016):</p>
			<img src="Rockmaw/Cacodemon.png" class="centerImg" style="width: 35%">
			<p>It was then clear that I needed some reds, some sort of green, and bone-tone colors. Here's the list of paints I bought for this model:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Army Painter's Elven Flesh.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Arid Earth.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Goblin Green.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Mythical Orange.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Crusted Sore.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Matt White.</li>
				<li>The Army Painter's Raven Black.</li>
			</ul>
			And I also used the following paints from my paint collection:
			<ul>
				<li>Vallejo Dark Red.</li>
				<li>AK Blood Red.</li>
			</ul>
