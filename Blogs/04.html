			<h2 style="text-align:center;">Tetrahedrons as an introduction to quantized geometry</h2>
			<p style="text-align:center;">January 2nd, 2024.</p>
			
			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			
					<p>One of my goals during winter break was to formally study some flashy/pop-science theories. One such theory is Loop Quantum Gravity, approached as a method for understanding Quantum Gravity.</p>
					
					<p>In this entry, I aim to explore the introductory ideas behind a basic geometrical body: the tetrahedron. Additionally, I will make the effects of quantization explicit through them. This entry is based on exercises presented in Carlo Rovelli's "Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity."</p>
			
			<h4>Describing the tetrahedron through an independent set of quantities</h4>
			
					<p>Let's start by recalling that a tetrahedron is the polyhedron we get when using four triangular faces. We consider them as they are the (3 dimensional) Euclidean simplex. It must be noted that we don't assume them to be regular.</p>
					
					<img src="04/Tetrahedron.PNG" class="centerImg" style="width: 40%;">
					
					<p>A unique way to characterize a tetrahedron is by introducing four vectors: $L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4 $. The $i^{\text{th} } $ vector $L_i $, corresponding to the $i^{\text{th} } $ triangular face, is defined as one half of the vector product of any two of the edges bounding such face.</p>

					<p>It is clear that the norm of the $i^{\text{th} } $ vector $L_i $ is equal to the area of the face it represents.</p>
					
					<p>The reader might ask "why can't we use more elementary quantities such as the 6 edges of the tetrahedron?" The issue with using such a set (among other sets) is that it comes with non-trivial inequalities.</p>
